         <h2>about</h2>
         <p>
          this is a website.
          i have poems and some art and recommendations and links. 
          btw I'm roger.
         </p>
         <p>
          i prefer the design of internet 1.0 so i'm trying to make this place from scratch 
          as much as possible and I have some "interesting" design ideas in the works.
         </p>
         <p>
          recently i've been really into poetry so expect a lot of that here. i also like to 
          rock climb but I don't really know how I would share that in a place like this. if
          you ever see me climbing don't be afraid to say hello!
         </p>
         <p>
          i want this place to be accessible but i'm not super familiar with how to do that
          let me know if you have any ideas
         </p>
