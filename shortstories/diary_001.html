            Littering is one of those things that has turned into a story over
            time by countless TV shows, radio outlets, and anxious groups of
            terrified people. A story that only has two characters. The World in
            her never ending benevolence who has never contained garbage (until
            industry rolled around), who is all providing in her flora and
            fauna, all encompassing in her magnitude, and all vulnerable to
            villains. One of these villains is The Litterer. Who according to
            Captain Planet and so many ad campaigns is a malignant tumor on the
            back of The World. One who drives in his beat up gas guzzling car,
            and throws his empty pack of cigarettes out the window along with a
            still lit cigarette butt. Someone in a wife beater who doesn't make
            alimony payments and is on his way home from the unemployment
            office. And all that trash has to go somewhere. Frankly, it's bull
            shit. None of it's real that person doesn't exist. Littering isn't a
            person or type of person, it's an action and we all litter,
            sometimes carelessly, usually accidentally, but rarely if ever are
            we malicious.

            It had rained through the night and while this provided a cozy nest
            to stimulate the needs of a youthful couple, it kept us shut in from
            enjoying this beautiful spring morning. A slow morning of TV and
            eggs clamped down on us keeping us cooped up. So when the first tap
            of April finally ran dry and the clouds parted, the girl and I were
            elated to finally frolic in the cool air. It was a typical walk,
            nothing extraordinary, she brought me around to all the usual
            landmarks. The hoagie place that apparently sold delicious hoagies
            that were the talk of the town but that had a flag with a thin blue
            line in it's shop window. The architecture building where so many
            beautiful creations made by young artists lie that it almost became
            banal again. Then to the permanently closed art show which I was
            assured was usually open, just never when I was around or when she
            was in the mood to visit it. But we still peered in appreciating the
            beautiful art from afar only visible due to the dim light of the
            windows.

            And it's unfortunate that she called it a hoagie place right?
            They're sub sandwiches not hoagies and she usually calls them that
            too. So why did she call it a hoagie place? It must have been at
            someone else's recommendation right? Did they not care that the
            place was clearly pro cop, or did they just not notice? It's kind of
            hard to miss though since it takes up 90% of the storefront's
            window. Or are the sandwiches so good that it just didn't matter to
            them. Maybe she was talking to someone that is pro-cop or uncaring
            about the whole affair though that seems almost impossible to me. It
            really didn't matter and it was all in my head, but still why did
            she- oh- it could be that HOAGIE is written in big bold letters on
            the storefront... Yeah it's probably that. Anyway.

            The campus was beautiful as it always is. And as I always saw it,
            was like a ghost town. A place that was meant to be inhabited by
            hundreds of young strung out minds was only inhabited by their half
            finished projects. It was a snapshot of a history that no one could
            even hope to understand in full but I could still appreciate it.
            That hard work took form in creative and beautiful architectural
            majesty. The girl told me the stories she knew about the people she
            liked and of course, deliciously, those she didn't. For
            instance there was the work of a man most infamous by the college.
            The so called meanest and most demanding professor had been working
            on scaling up the design of an already constructed city block. He
            had one wrinkled sheet of paper and about 5 lines. Hypocrite, and we
            laughed. The building we were touring had once been an old
            gymnasium, retro fit to house the architecture student body and it's
            affiliates. The pool once full of athletes had become a library. The
            heights of a gym ceiling became additional studio space patched
            together by concrete bridges. This place of art and beauty is just
            what we needed on a slow rainy Saturday.

            Another thing about littering is the impermanence of each littered
            object. Each item fallen will eventually be picked up by something
            else. Leftover fries out a window if they're lucky might get eaten
            by a rat or a dog or a possum. But most likely it will get eaten by
            bacteria and decay and turn spoiled, then slowly become the dirt it
            had crashed down on. Meanwhile it's plastic container will just sit
            there. Biding it's time with a much slower fate. At some point
            somebody might come a long wearing a high vis jacket and pick it up
            and put it in a trash bag. Where does that trash bag go? Away.
            Another possibility for that plastic container is eons. Not every
            highway has regular cleanup operations. So eventually that plastic
            container will be rained on and weathered and seasons will pass and
            dirt will slowly fill the space fries once sat. To buried in a tomb
            that will outlast the life of the person who threw it out. But then
            of course there is local litter. The stuff that gets cast aside
            where people walk and work and play. This stuff can get chewed up by
            someone's toddler. Or picked up by a local do-gooder and they might
            just find treasure in another man's trash.

            We could see the clouds looming. So the pressure was on to return to
            the nest with our harvest of novelty. So back we traveled past the
            closed art show, the architecture building, and the hoagie place.
            And to my surprise as we were making idle chatter I spotted a bowl
            of cereal on the ground. No milk in it obviously, it was one of
            those sealed packs they make for events or travel where theres a
            plastic bowl and a flexile plastic lid. So I picked it up, and
            although my partner reacted in disgust at me eating this littered
            meal, I saw on the ground another. And another and all at once I had
            545 calories of off brand cereal in one hand. Wondering who dropped
            these and why. The Litterer made his appearance in my mind but it
            didn't make sense here. This wasn't trash it was food, not even
            expired. So the litter transformed into an opened truck, no that
            doesn't make sense? A college student? Possible but they wouldn't
            waste all this. But I decided The Litterer was actually a busy mom
            bringing her kid to an event where she was supposed to bring the
            cereal. And being a kid the cart got kicked or shoved and a few
            boxes of cereal collapsed on the grass. I could hear her scolding
            the kid but being in a rush and distracted by all the chaos of daily
            life the mother either didn't notice or accepted the loss and so
            continued on her way to whatever event was so important this week.
            But that cereal wealth was now mine and boy did it taste sweet.
