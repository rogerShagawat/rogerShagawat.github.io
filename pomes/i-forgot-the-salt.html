    </p>
    <p>
      Prod and push, and push and pull.<br>
      Broth divine with white wine mull.<br>
      Diced the carrots soft but firm.<br>
      Potatoes and peas all a churn.<br>
      Fire hot liquid boiling in tune.<br>
      Set to simmer as I grab my spoon.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      A taste to ease the buds...<br>
      Something's missing, tastes like mud.<br>
      Pantry flies spices gone to roost<br>
      Search and search but not produced<br>
      How could I do this how could I betray<br>
      I forgot the salt. GOD, WHY MAKE ME THIS WAY?!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It shouldn't be hard I'm not making curry<br>
      With bag in hand was in a hurry<br>
      The soup is ruined I must confess<br>
      Can't believe I went and made all this mess<br>
      Pour the soup down the drain<br>
      What a waste but I'm to blame<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dribbling down my face a tear falls into the pot<br>
      Flavor falling but the heart is set on not<br>
      Following through I can't do anything right<br>
      Now here comes that eternal fight<br>
      I could just buy more salt but it's too late now<br>
      This always happens just can't tell how.<br>
