title: wolf<br>
theme: against a canvas</p>
<p>I think I would be a wolf,<br>
candles licking at the page<br>
to stop a bubbling brook<br>
takes rocks and wood and wage</p>
<p>burning boiling magma<br>
takes a more thought out touch<br>
to stop its flowing rhythm<br>
takes a careful thoughtful brush</p>
<p>but laborious endeavors<br>
require organizational faculties<br>
kings, pharaohs, prophets, emperors<br>
old and tired majesties</p>
<p>the machine god on high<br>
will direct every single one of us<br>
to work and slave and die<br>
by your next due date on canvas</p></body>
