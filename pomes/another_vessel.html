      on the vessel time was not important but was always kept<br>
      high above all, nothing could be touched, everything could be felt<br>
      from a distance on the instruments<br>
      not self sufficient the air is leaking<br>
      all will end<br>
      the air is leaking and the hours tick on bye<br>
      the instruments said everything they saw would end<br>
      they can fix it fix the leak<br>
      they can't there's nothing left not even tape<br>
      alone<br>
      adrift<br>
      running out of air<br>
      the airlock opens<br>
      it's time.<br>
      it's over.<br>
      an alien<br>
      i scramble to the instruments<br>
      i know nothing<br>
      it gives me a warm embrace<br>
      none i have ever felt before<br>
      the instruments don't help<br>
      leaking,<br>
      leaking,<br>
      warm,<br>
