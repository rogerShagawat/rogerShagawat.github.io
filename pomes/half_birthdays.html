      title: half birthdays<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      what is my purpose here?<br>
      pondered in the back of this oft unvisited sauna<br>
      am i trying to escape even with this lack of trauma<br>
      cast to walk alone barely together<br>
      training for things that i never remember<br>
      is it applied science? this all encompassing solitude<br>
      why is there no purpose in life something to strive for<br>
      all our ancestors searching for food having everything to die for<br>
      not saying it would be easy i just wouldn't be so confused<br>
      i would cherish even my half birthdays because i wouldn't be fused<br>
      with the ground or those i can no longer access<br>
      striving for nothing including success<br>
      water splashes onto the coals turning to vapor<br>
      should i remain still or try to be written on paper<br>
      a flush from just beyond the door as a patron enters<br>
      we try not to look at each other as distance sits us apart<br>
      wafting from the only other door the stench of farts<br>
      i get up and leave<br>
