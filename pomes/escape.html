    <p>
      here i eat under this hulking blue mass<br>
      the currents stirring keeping strong and fast<br>
      couldn't ask for better<br>
      without task or tether<br>
      but OOOOUUUCCCHHH no longer in my COOOOUUUUUCCH<br>
      what predator is this<br>
      an otter? yet no prying from fists<br>
      perhaps a human? grasping for pearl with a frown,<br>
      but no, by now certainly i'd be drowned?<br>
      maybe a creature with jaws which crush any matter?<br>
      no, by now one of us would surely be shattered<br>
      the pressure grows and grows shell about to falter<br>
      i hadn't even considered<br>
      but it must be a gigantic ancient lobster!<br>
      struggle as i may i cannot match its claw!<br>
      but perhaps i can slip aw-<br>
      CRACK!<br>
      entrails burst from the old clam's shell<br>
      the lobster's grip crushing with a final spell<br>
      now to feast with mouth agape<br>
      a pearl comes bursting out to finally escape<br>
