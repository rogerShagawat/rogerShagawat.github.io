      title: I-80<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      here I am in this car stretched out on I-80<br>
      on all sides surrounded by my copies<br>
      fog so thick you could cut it<br>
      fog so thick we can barely see each other<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I-80 begins in Albany California born from Route 101 in a manger between Trader Joes and REI<br>
      I-80 ends crushed between Teaneck and Ridgefield Park, crashing against the shores of Overpeck Park Playground, washing away as Interstate 95<br>
      2,545.4 miles separate me from it's birth 23.87 miles separate me from its death.<br>
      I have never seen either<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      here we are racing along its life at 70 miles per hour,<br>
      faster when we can, slower when sirens remind us not to.<br>
      we all have places to go. things to eat. people to be<br>
      we will never see each other's faces, learn each other's names,<br>
      no time for that.<br>
      and the fog won't let up.<br>
