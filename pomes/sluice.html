      taps turned and the bathtub fills;<br>
      water churned as clothing spills;<br>
      relaxation takes its place.<br>
      candles lit to fill the space,<br>
      with comforting aura i dip a toe,<br>
      perfect temperature a warming glow.<br>
      one final step to complete the ritual,<br>
      a bath bomb set to brew the spiritual,<br>
      i watch it fizz and fill the tub,<br>
      as i lay down and prepare soaps and body rubs.<br>
      but what's this?!<br>
      something seems a miss?<br>
      perchance i missed a candle?<br>
      no they're all alight.<br>
      perhaps the heat and reach for the handle;<br>
      no the water is quite alright,<br>
      ah it's the tunes i didn't notice!<br>
      “alexa play yasuke by flying lotus!”<br>
      finally i sink down and enjoy my well prepared swim,<br>
      thoughts un-focused dreaming of clowns and spells and my day at the gym,<br>
      but this time is private and awash with solitude,<br>
      so i will not bore you with a wash of privates and my empty platitudes.<br>
      eventually it comes to an end, it's time to get out,<br>
      i pull the plug at the end, and blow the candles out,<br>
      staring at the whirlpool regret fills my head,<br>
      i could have enjoyed that longer, but alas time for bed,<br>
      i step out and wrap up in a nice fluffy towel.<br>
      when suddenly i notice a feeling most foul<br>
      to the floor i stick<br>
      dyed the towel is, colored brick!<br>
      and my hair, oh! how it feels most unpleasant<br>
      it's at this moment i glance at the bath<br>
      oh god it's pulpy and covered in ants!<br>
      “could it be?!” i think to myself “no it could not be the truth!”<br>
      this delightful and relaxing self sluice!<br>
      was really a nightMARE WASH IN A BATH FULL OF ORANGE JUICE!!<br>
