      passing through an oft forgotten factor<br>
      the pitter patter now it's true<br>
      what i was told on the monitor<br>
      coming down like cats and dogs<br>
      the muddied bog, occasional drown<br>
      yet in only hours, dried and through<br>
      who could believe we all shied away<br>
      where we stain the day with roofs relieve<br>
      ignoring dirt's arrange to mammal's tree<br>
      awakened worms glee new divot on the chert<br>
      after all that's changed or hurt we see a similar but different view<br>
