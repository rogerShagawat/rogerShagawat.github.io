    </p>
    <p>
      i lift my toe into the air<br>
      drop it low cast off care<br>
      with a boom cats scurry sweep the broom in a hurry crumbs flying everywhere<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      perhaps it's time to come to grips<br>
      this lack of rhyme thunderous rips<br>
      tear through the very soul of a man<br>
      though i am inept with bowl and pan<br>
      i'll take those shrieks to heart<br>
      and touch down.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      with swift row and far more care<br>
    </p>
