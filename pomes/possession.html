    <p>
      to the library<br>
      to the tavern<br>
      pluck some berries<br>
      in the cavern<br>
      doing orderlies<br>
      i find myself<br>
      something FREEZE<br>
      whats this on the shelf?<br>
      it all must stop<br>
      every task i'm told to do<br>
      something more important<br>
      something new<br>
      run to the workshop!<br>
      this desire blatant<br>
      hauling bones and opal and malachite<br>
      through this hall of thrones and hope all alunite<br>
      beginning my task i find my flow<br>
      or has it already set in?<br>
      hands working so fast they appear to glow<br>
      all to satisfy my vision<br>
      i chip and shave beast's hardened flesh<br>
      with chisel pick and dagger<br>
      setting gemstones pardoned fresh<br>
      from stone well bellow the magma<br>
      with a final stone set<br>
      i gaze at repaid debt<br>
      nothing can compare<br>
      nothing comes close<br>
      to this blessed and perfect chair<br>
      totally engrossed<br>
      a name is needed,<br>
      i'll call it Klascanose.<br>
      i offer it to you<br>
      you who listened without question<br>
      to an old yet story new<br>
      of humble dwarf possession<br>
