    <p>
      walking long this lonely path family surrounding<br>
      a glance at sky high above light cast in delicate rays<br>
      staring at me a man with face quite confounding<br>
      wink and grin working charm casting smiling ways<br>
      can't help but smile back happiness rebounding<br>
      reaching out for warmth playful children like clay<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      walking sometimes stumbling the earth fresh and intense<br>
      conversation of love, philosophy, science, and games<br>
      what a joy this man is! happy just being in his presence<br>
      seeking agency asked with careful diligence exchange of names<br>
      sorrow creeps back to the mans once joyous grin<br>
      "perhaps let's hear yours first" then to delve deep within<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      what could it be what could it be.<br>
      what is this i don't understand.<br>
      my name should be right hear<br>
      next to my pituitary gland<br>
      but i'm drawing a blank<br>
      and i don't wish to disturb<br>
      so i feign a smile and say<br>
      why it's "Herb"<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      and he looks down hiding a frown<br>
      "Do you know where we are?" he asks with sullen voice<br>
      "Why we're in the woods!" I rejoice though knowing somethings amiss<br>
      down again at the trail dirt starting to drown<br>
      "Hey wipe that frown" i beg "look at the sky at all this bliss"<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      then i turn around and am shocked to see<br>
      a gaggle of strangers staring back at me<br>
      "who are all these people" i whisper in shock<br>
      "you're children" he mumbles head tilted to rock<br>
      not possible no it just can't be<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      after hours of walking in silenced screams<br>
      we come to building i never have seen<br>
      the man takes out now what-what was it called?<br>
      and suddenly a new space takes over and all<br>
      over the house i see pictures of me<br>
      with people i don't know but they seem to know me<br>
      but it must be a plot something to take over<br>
      i sit in a chair and sink lower and lower<br>
      "i'll put on some tea" the man walks to the kitchen<br>
      what's the time dumbfounded i stare at the clock<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      then a shadow moves distant fast and quick<br>
      a horror contorts me and i freeze still as brick<br>
      then all in a rush a great beast assaults me<br>
      throwing feeble arms and legs attempt to free<br>
      its hunger obvious drool falls in slobbering dollops<br>
      someone strong comes over and extracts the polyp<br>
      cowering still i'm asked if alright<br>
      no! no! no i'm not nothing is right!<br>
      "thank you... um..." but i'm drawing a blank<br>
      "Herb" he says then pets the terrifying mass<br>
      which i'm shocked to see is a small cute thing<br>
      i chuckle to myself then i'm handed some tea<br>
      "oh this is my favorite" then i look at the clock<br>
      "say. who are all these people?"<br>
