            Blonde locks across the mind.
            Once for all I cherished
            A toy to still the eye.
            
            In age a treasure lost
            Corrupted in the skies
            A distance change has wrought
            Yet heart cannot deny
            
            Appreciate anew.
            Form has stilled the mind
            Through sign and mirror view.
            Worship forms our bind.
