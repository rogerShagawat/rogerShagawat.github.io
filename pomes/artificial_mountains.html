      title: artificial mountains
    </p>
    <p>staring at artificial mountains, 
      candlelight in tepid waters.
      born of sweat and blood.
      steel spires never falter
      rock hewn paths coat the feet of travelers.
      yet not a soul persists.
      what is this lonely world?
      our creations staring back at us without the beauty we put in them?
      i say no more!
      bring back long forgotten biomes!
      rich fertile plains!
      sparse dense pine forests devouring rains!
      dark and damp caves filled with light!
      and the bogs to anthropological delight!
      bees and bugs and rodents too!
      and all the little things we kept loose!
      the crane and prairie dog spur the rat and pigeon!
      still enjoying our artificial world in our new dominion!
      giving up does not mean losing, now take hold and discard the anguishâ€¦</p>
