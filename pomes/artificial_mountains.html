      title: artificial mountains<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      staring at artificial mountains,<br>
      candlelight in tepid waters.<br>
      born of sweat and blood.<br>
      steel spires never falter<br>
      rock hewn paths coat the feet of travelers.<br>
      yet not a soul persists.<br>
      what is this lonely world?<br>
      our creations staring back at us without the beauty we put in them?<br>
      i say no more!<br>
      bring back long forgotten biomes!<br>
      rich fertile plains!<br>
      sparse dense pine forests devouring rains!<br>
      dark and damp caves filled with light!<br>
      and the bogs to anthropological delight!<br>
      bees and bugs and rodents too!<br>
      and all the little things we kept loose!<br>
      the crane and prairie dog spur the rat and pigeon!<br>
      still enjoying our artificial world in our new dominion!<br>
      giving up does not mean losing, now take hold and discard the anguishâ€¦<br>
