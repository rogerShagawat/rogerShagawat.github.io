    <p>
      tom takes the quarter out of his pocket and inserts it into the machine<br>
      “Honey let's go see that new movie”<br>
      his wife is standing there trying to get a stain out of her pink blouse<br>
      “I don't know where the theater is”<br>
      a can of coca cola is dispensed from the machine<br>
      “whose this for?”<br>
      his wife rubs her sponge against the blouse more vigorously now<br>
      “hello how can i help you?” the cashier says<br>
      “2 for Starry Night Flame”<br>
      the cashier hands tom 2 tickets each on an 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper<br>
      the stain won't come out<br>
      the couple sit down <br>
      they ordered 2 drinks and a large popcorn<br>
      “just like old times hey hun”<br>
      the stain still isn't coming out, it seems to be spreading on the blouse<br>
      a man in all green stands up and shouts “fire fire fire”<br>
      he points up at the projector<br>
      a faint glow of orange emanates from the projector room, smoke billowing out and going up through the chimney<br>
      the movie starts and tom wraps his arm around his wife whose to concentrated to notice<br>
      “tom did you turn the oven off”<br>
      tom turns around to see a face in the projector room<br>
      “what oven?”<br>
      “tom you've forgotten haven't you”<br>
      flames lick the face from top to bottom<br>
      “the oven tom”<br>
      the fire alarm goes off and people calmly exit the theater<br>
      tom takes a sip of his drink and a bite of his popcorn<br>
      the blouse is fully covered in the stain and the sponge is saturated with a purple liquid<br>
      “looks like we have the theater all to ourselves”<br>
      credits roll<br>
      “is that it?”<br>
      tom tried to read the paper in his hand but it's to covered in popcorn butter to make out any of the words<br>
      curtains close and the audience erupts in applause<br>
      tom sits silently waiting<br>
      the applause grows louder and louder<br>
      his wife joins in covered in a dark purple film which drips off her and forms a stream down the aisle<br>
      tom sinks low into his seat and covers his eyes<br>
      and they don't stop applauding<br>
      and they don't stop applauding<br>
      and they don't stop applauding…<br>
