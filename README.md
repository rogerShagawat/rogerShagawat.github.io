This is an old version of my personal website I used to host my poetry, projects, and a short description of myself.

This was made primarily using JavaScript HTML and CSS and still matches some of my favorite design and color ideas (sepia)

I'm currently designing a new website for myself in React.js so keep an eye on my GitHub page to see when that get's upoaded!
